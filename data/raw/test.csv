that difficult question answer some people don really like schiit because their customer service ceo the way talks about his product and the results independent 3rd party measurements makes him come off incredibly pompous that enough deter next that they measure insanely poorly for their price range this where the discussion gets fun some people swear that the errors introduced schiit gear make music sound better others say that there reason that chinese device that costs fraction what schiit charges topping d30 should measure better pretty much every category pretty much argument between objectivists measurements and mathematics and subjectivists essentially just listen how sounds and base your opinions that think schiit marketing what really props everything for them from the irreverent marketing pages the name designed appealing and endearing and does great job that but far audio with everything else subjective but rather spend money elsewhere for alternative lot people talk the audio products have the r2r and has some errors the audible spectrum according the ultimate headphone test sounds and have yet hear sound where the particular error itself can heard and distinguished from the music only the frequency test brought attention the error the dac portion getting new amp wouldn fix the issue that being said like try some more products down the line topping and audio nfb specifically that civil enough answer sources were sbaf sorry lost the threads and pretty much all the links posted here from audio science review ,1

this comment had posted earlier cents will try explain why think lost people seem quick criticize modi for communal problems india was born and brought mangalore communal tension common there every year used have school shutdown for few days and bajrang dal was and very strong there some small things like muslim boy marrying hindu girl hindu boy marrying muslim girl would tick people off from both sides and shit would escalate out control was from hindu brahmin family and even was afraid bajrang dal when modi came power there was massive rally these nutcase hindu groups many school friends participated this rally unfortunately and people this rally were openly saying things like now you wait and see what happens muslim neighborhoods they all think their time has come they all feel they won touched and that they have the pms support that why they have become extra bold modi responds strongly one incident against right wing just once come out openly and say something throw some these people jail these people will know not with their shit but unfortunately central government hasn done that both sides treat them both equally and throw people from both sides jail that even better but modi needs take strong stance against religious intolerance from both sides not the rise intolerance that the problem the fact that most these extreme right wing crazies think they have centers support and take center silence yes have seen and talked many bajrang dal mangalore and they truly believe and the other communities think they are under attack and also think the center supports the right wing sure center doesn support either side but silence not helping one clear and loud message from modi condemning both sides and rss etc for this will get everyone confidence back that edit lots comments cannot individually reply but some clarification not saying modi responsible not saying has apologize for every incident that crazy and unfair cant hold one person accountable for billion people that humanely not possible but because lot right wing crazies think modi supports them modi comes out and clarifies once and for all people will calm down right wing will know they dont have the support support dont mean legal support states duty many said and the minorities will stop crying that supports them someone below mentioned about discrimination against black community the example when black people went rampage obama did make statement that was not for black people riot like the way they were many people thought obama was support blacklivesmatter because black too but came out and said understands their frustration but was dead against their method showing that frustration actually came out and acknowledged the shitty behavior minority was doing even though black community hardcore supporters his own democratic party just modi coming out and openly criticizing these right wing actions will calm things down certain extent ,1

 read answer quora but direct links aren allowed here just paste the answer here though the images the answer are lost also don agree with the answer completely but interesting counterpoint the general viewpoint have about hindutva question why did veer sawarkar form hindu mahasabha was atheist answer culture the physical manifestation individual spiritual immortality humans despite our mortal bodies crude natures flawed minds are luminous beings who can exist for millennia travel across oceans will and speak entire generations once under the right conditions for this one only one condition must met the individual must overcome their delusions mortality instead identify with immortal reality once that done all else follows the primary fallacy the average atheist makes the course their reading their belief that they somehow slipped off the chains religion delusion developed some sort individualistic freedom that nonsense the only thing they done exchange one set chains for another there absolutely difference between the rituals organized religion the flag marches communism for that matter liberal socialism there heaven religious liberal there was never any heaven merely duty never ending thankless duty part unknowing all knowing greater being with sense individual good evil even indifference that what the bhagavad gita actually says that what liberals don understand human beings want have part greater whole this sentiment the very basis humanity its civilizations its ethos religion like all ideologies merely another set lies meant justify the existence yet another unjust exploitative society because all societies their very collective existence are unjust exploitative the individual but that okay because human beings either want exploit exploited themselves even the holy liberals are bound their own set untruths and thus must constantly justifying arguing over group nonentities they not see that their stand absolute knowledge different from that adopted the christians muslims when they were persecuting being persecuted the pagans who preceded them there not single argument liberals have that hasn been raised ten thousand times earlier thomas aquinas lao tzu the buddha himself the mahabharata there not single argument the god delusion that hasn been discussed far more exhaustively dedicatedly comprehensively the tripitakas there isn single criticism the bible that wasn known countered thomas aquinas the individuals concerned thomas aquinas the buddha were not only far more intelligent learned enlightened than your liberal thinks they were all probability some the most intelligent beings grace this species the idea that they were foolish enough fall under some sort superstitious nonsense ridiculous they believe because choose chose order defend our chosen group the virtues sins this group whether this group christians hindus muslims even the people known certain circles sickulars don even figure this equation “for after all how know that two and two make four that the force gravity works that the past unchangeable both the past and the external world exist only the mind and the mind itself controllable – what then ” thus clearly see that the tribe the fundamental necessity well the ultimate goal human existence how this tribe defines itself called culture this culture turn can defined multiple factors race religion the communist manifesto the mein kampf nietzsche the god delusion course organized religion any tribe virtue the numerical superiority philosophical strength provides its members superior any number individuals thus dominates the latter through slaughter plunder therein lies the crux why the three great monotheistic faiths christianity islam judaism have destroyed virtually every single pagan faith the world save for india china paganism simply not robust enough ideology effectively bind people together too individualistic offers too many choices has too many freedoms don mistake freedom for the lack oppression murdering babies though that might been pure roman anti carthiginian propaganda burning widows which was the british digging nearly extinct traditions anti hindu propaganda are oppression but they not connote lack freedom the mere allowing choice within one spiritual thus cultural fabric paganism weakens the tribe thus paves the way for its own demise then why did india china survive the answer simple what the biggest factor that sets india china apart from the world and thus our hordes have given these two civilizations the immortality not even eternal egypt mighty rome could aspire like dragons outfought our pagan foes like monkeys cheated the mongol tumens like rats out bred our civilized monotheist oppressors thus survived but this state affairs could never continued for ever fertility rates fall schools open teach new lies place old ones people their eternal search for suffering hanker after new more horrifying tortures what people forget that leaving their religion they are effectively abandoning their own culture thus the very basis human civilization true they gain better softer society society more amenable individualistic bliss but such state affairs can only temporary before such hedonistic loosely bound members are swept away hard unthinking orthodoxy hindus long protected from the depredations islam christianity their vast population multifarious ethnic divisions warlike nature the early 1900s were open such culturalization thanks several events not under this answer purview thus was evident any well read indian the early 1900s that india concept was doomed extinction all said and done india hindu concept created hindus populated hindus defined hindus don give that secular nonsense hinduism like all indo european faiths does not correlate morality with divinity and thus shows tolerance for other religions unknown any faith currently existing earth yes even buddhism christians would got with their belief mythical jerusalem muslims would gone praying arab stone but india india are neither israel arabia and thus was born hindutva racial pride for made race one believed cultural pride for non existent culture land with millions civilizational pride for civilization that had long passed into legend fallen into barbarism religious pride for made religion that had carved out from the very forces meant oppose what savarkar being atheist real atheist unlike the anti national conformist phonies quora the indian liberals realized was that hinduism was unlikely survive for long merely account being pagan faith and with hinduism would gone the very essence india think yourself there are thousands dance traditions india how many them are islamic origin how many are christian origin how many ragas have the communists authored what good have the hordes the indian media done for humanity after one thousand years what good would bunch shouting news anchors have accomplished and yet play the same raga bhairavi the emperor samudragupta once played his veena thousand years before the first ship sailed around africa the same raga ustad bismillah khan performed every day the ghats varanasi until few years ago thus savarkar remade hinduism from christianity came the purpose violence militaristic organization from islam came the stress ideological purity defensiveness from judaism came the emphasis free enterprise racial religious existence the world oldest religion was reforged the very image the newest order withstand new crueller more ignorant humanity what did was different from what ataturk did when rebuilt new turkey form the ashes the ottoman porte when mao took the most bitter war torn people the world recast them into united china was nationalist everything did was for the nation for posterity judge his actions not but judge his intentions his character judged intellectual pygmies who haven had single original thought their own veer savarkar

thanissaro bhikkhu “ all know what happens when fire goes out the flames die down and the fire gone for good when first learn that the name for the goal buddhist practice nibbana nirvana literally means the extinguishing fire hard imagine deadlier image for spiritual goal utter annihilation turns out though that this reading the concept mistake translation not much word image what did extinguished fire represent the indians the buddha day anything but annihilation according the ancient brahmans when fire was extinguished went into state latency rather than ceasing exist became dormant and that state — unbound from any particular fuel — became diffused throughout the cosmos when the buddha used the image explain nibbana the indian brahmans his day bypassed the question whether extinguished fire continues exist not and focused instead the impossibility defining fire that doesn burn thus his statement that the person who has gone totally out can described however when teaching his own disciples the buddha used nibbana more image freedom apparently all indians the time saw burning fire agitated dependent and trapped both clinging and being stuck its fuel burned ignite fire one had seize when fire let its fuel was freed released from its agitation dependence and entrapment — calm and unconfined this why pali poetry repeatedly uses the image extinguished fire metaphor for freedom fact this metaphor part pattern fire imagery that involves two other related terms well upadana clinging also refers the sustenance fire takes from its fuel khandha means not only one the five heaps form feeling perception thought processes and consciousness that define all conditioned experience but also the trunk tree just fire goes out when stops clinging and taking sustenance from wood the mind freed when stops clinging the khandhas thus the image underlying nibbana one freedom the pali commentaries support this point tracing the word nibbana its verbal root which means unbinding what kind unbinding the texts describe two levels one the unbinding this lifetime symbolized fire that has gone out but whose embers are still warm this stands for the enlightened arahant who conscious sights and sounds sensitive pleasure and pain but freed from passion aversion and delusion the second level unbinding symbolized fire totally out that its embers have grown cold what the arahant experiences after this life all input from the senses cools away and she totally freed from even the subtlest stresses and limitations existence space and time the buddha insists that this level indescribable even terms existence nonexistence because words work only for things that have limits all really says about — apart from images and metaphors — that one can have foretastes the experience this lifetime and that the ultimate happiness something truly worth knowing the next time you watch fire going out see not case annihilation but lesson how freedom found letting ” html,1

politicians are usually very subtle about how they about moulding public opinion these days more blatant but then partisanship has also increased you look how they pushed through regulations and how they are eroding our fundamental rights scary thing the supreme court recently said that the fundamental freedoms are not absolute and the state can take away this the most alarming thing that have ever heard this means that they can challenge and even end the freedom religion press speech assembly against exploitation etc the core values our nation and constitution was based this could mean that religion becomes part the government and politics not good mix theocracies are the least free countries out there and the most regressive the problem with the current government how they are using rhetoric divide the country more than anything else they called entire universities anti national they doctored videos show student leaders bad light they made people stand for national anthems theaters enforcement being infringement our rights too used the political machinery stifle dalit voices attacked the patriotism everyone who opposed them used the armed forces political tool shamed people for complaining about being unable access their hard earned money because poor government policy invoking soldiers two their states have passed strict conversion laws tried incite violence kerala among other states passed beef ban creating aura fear encouraged vigilantism thereby undermining the power police and judiciary pretty much endorsing bullying coercion and fearmongering have insulted and harassed and villified intellectuals scientists reformists rationalists journalists and activists thereby stifling free speech and also causing harm the ones exercising the problem not just doing these things but also forming public opinion that these are the right things making people themselves forgo their fundamental rights unknowingly this erodes the constitution and our democratic framework and dangerous for the nation this how fascist and authoritarian states like franco spain mussolini italy and ergodan turkey trump america and putin russia were formed not desirable outcome ,-1

most religions have dogmatic orthodox well esoteric philosophic side the christian heaven can seen palace the clouds state mind rebirth buddhism can seen fact just superstition left over from other beliefs you interpret and understand you see fit like think about various religions talking about the same thing using different words and yes cherry pick what believe but honestly and very carefully think better than taking everything religion says and rejecting everything doesn say there must hundred different ways talk about enlightenment heaven pure land individuation alchemy rites passage education trials meditation the tricky part that what describes can easily explained words and most importantly has understood which different than just knowing reading about the pure land real place state mind doubt real place but sure some will believe buddhism has some dogma but not nearly much eastern religions ,1

these two paragraphs are the most important this entire writeup are you lusting after canon 5ds before you convince yourself that you really really need this camera remind yourself that few short years ago the canon 5dmkii was state the art was used world famous photographers shoot anything from vogue covers billboards national geographic features there are millions fantastic images out there that were taken with this camera six years later these images still look amazing galleries and coffee table books images from the 5dmkii are still proudly displayed the portfolios your biggest photography heroes think about that ’ their portfolios you back just few more years you’ find world press photo winners and acclaimed magnum series that were shot with cameras like the top the line nikon d2x case you forgot that camera had megapixel crop sensor and maximum extended iso 3200 you own modern entry level dslr you probably have double those specs plus live view and video and god knows what else your lowly d5300 better than what the best photographers the world had the early 2000s and they were taking some excellent photos back then many people the questions thread saying their t6i due for upgrade because old and need full frame while not being able explain why when you ask they quickly google crop full frame and skim few articles then come back the questions thread reply and say better low light performance they also think that cameras are like computers and need upgraded every year two not understanding that nothing changes with camera software that requires updated hardware camera that takes excellent photos today will still take excellent photos years those two paragraphs nail that concept really well that said this entire writeup extremely well written and valuable thank you for contributing lilgreenrosetta ,1

first the author conclusion that buddhism lacks selfless love wrong straight out the gate really couldn more wrong the whole ideal bodhisattva help all beings attain enlightenment there other way become buddha than that buddhas and bodhisattvas are definition motivated selfless love half the realization emptiness selfless love compassion there emptiness without compassion even the context the theravadan example they posted how the offerings the laity monks not selfless love they are freely giving themselves and their possessions someone else not selfless love because the recipients are monks that doesn make any sense will admit that some the faults they find with jodo shinshu are somewhat valid but not because think they are true but because think they are very common misconceptions arrive shin buddhism part the mahayana has all the selfless love and everything else associated with the mahayana whole but the emphasis even evil person being able reach the pure land can hard understand and can seem very christiany there also the idea shin buddhism that you immediately attain buddhahood upon birth the pure land can sound like you don have anything but say amida name one time honestly don think shinran ever actually meant that you would immediately become buddha upon rebirth and think certain passages his writings are misinterpreted towards that conclusion frankly this why never stuck with jodo shinshu don think modern shin teachings entirely line with what shinran was saying this partly because shinran writings are incredibly dense and difficult parse which another reason was dissatisfying the issue one repetition the comment entirely misunderstood you don say once and get saved you have receive faith first and this usually gained through daily recitation and deep listening investigating the teachings and your own reality when you really realize your bombu nature your inability help yourself that what opens your heart receive faith shin buddhism that moment your faith stabilized and frankly this faith should make you better person doesn just give you free pass let you disassociate something supposed allow you build and recognize fuller picture your own flawed reality you can really recognize and accept yourself warts and all that the moment you can begin change and change without overbearing sense guilt you might get from christianity and that what shin buddhism aiming you can recognize your faults how can you become better person but honestly think all these issues could have been avoided the author the comment had been familiar with other pure land schools like jodo shu mainland pure land rather than shin shin rather unique some its interpretations other school teaches that you will attain buddhahood upon rebirth and opinion the notion rather silly and contradicts pretty much the entirety buddhism other schools not place the emphasis one own inability that makes sound like you don need change have selfless love don think any these things interpreted the comment are truly part shin buddhism but they are common misinterpretations with the way commonly taught ,1

first all kudos you for summarizing some very thoughtful points against aap such articles are rare come this subreddit where most the political discussions end descending karma grabbing mud slinging matches and deserves more upvotes have your questions except for their infinite faith and ability simply presume good what the aap supporters base their support believe that the most the supporters have put their faith the past record activism one man arvind kejriwal which pretty much synonymous the case bjp main man narendra modi both their records are out the open for everyone see and fair kejriwal has been tireless social worker even before the whole anna thing blew guess both bjp and aap supporters need asking this question what happens when the sole leader doesn live the promises you vote for person ideology system how ensure that everyone sticks that ideology system modi fan myself but find very difficult answer that well the long run what can aap give that the congress didn and couldn only time will tell that one but most people are hoping for corruption free government lets see how far they take delhi the power collective good intentions the water and power policies not seem panning out how earth aap different from congress under the sun today same old minority appeasement same old subsidy tricks same old attacks narendra modi seems like aap the mirror image congress only under different guise you got there other than few fresh faces the same old system compromises over accountability hoping proven wrong they are freaking corrupt why the heck are aapians not putting them jail instead taking their help this what want understand give this one aap for they didn back down play the dirty game the situation demanded but there was good chance that bjp might have swept more seats there was election also their conditions stunt was just childish nonsense ,1

this article nothing very substantive 迄今为止，“印度制造”的任务是失败的。 文章是虚构的，目的是让中国能解决逐渐浮现的各种弊病。 目前印度还看不到能成为大规模制造业中心的前景。 很多领域的生产能力远远落后中国，而规模对成本有很大影响。 这个人是明白人。。。。

many your points such welfare education healthcare are services that are offerred all citizens not special service only offered minorities such only indicator wealthier and more socialist society not indicator society that treats minorities especially well your logic similar western countries have better roads and infrastructure minorities get use this better infrastructure along with everyone else and hence minorities are treated better western countries this wrong logic you can only prove this you can prove that non western countries not let minorities use the social infrastructure their other majority citizens other words they treat them worse relatively speaking point you have done lot cherrypicking will take india example india has had very long history assimilating minorities into its society and very tolerant society well you also have take into account that far more populous country far denser country terms population density far poorer country most importantly has far more diversity than most western european countries the reality western european countries are only superficially tolerant minorities because has never become big enough issue for them they are wealthy lead fairly insular lives and their lives really not get affected when they take small measured quantities minorities controlled doses acts generosity challenges with minority diversity religious beliefs etc only become true challenges when people are jostling each other constantly for limited resources limited cultural space when cultural pactices are constantly intruding your daily lives when you have dozen mosques your immediate neighborhood all blaring the namaaz call times day while you also have dozen hindu temples that blast religious songs loudspeaker during festivals while you also have roads blocked off because observed christian festivals and processions and you have deal with all this while you have scramble for work nwxt morning when you are daily wage earner earning peanuts and have take overcrowded public transportation again jostling hundreds people from all walks life and all religions and ethinicities this far cry from the peace and quiet you enjoy your hermetic ikea home while you get work clockwork precision and tidiness and more importantly the immigrants and minorities not disturb your daily bliss all course you can generous and benrvolent but consider the chaos and poverty consider that population billion people crammed into megacities and with the second largest muslim population the world more muslims than probably the entire middle east still live fairly peacefully point put the right context denying the religious riot that happened 2002 but also note there have been religious issues after that well and that too under the rule the same political party anything india laws aggressively protect minorities minorities india have full access the social infrastructure others mosques and churches and gurudwaras and zoroastrian fire temples and synagogues coexist quite peacefully with hindu temples even extremely crowded urbanized cities minorities also vote equally and most cases are more aggressive politically and get their minority candidates voted who also safeguards their interests and rights despite being contentious isssue india laws for minorities are far more sophisticated and evolved compared most western european countries personal law and marital law for example tailor made respect and protect minority religions hindu personal law for example very different from muslim personal law which dfferent from christian personal law there are religious law board that provide advice and feedback courts and government all religious and personal law issues you look any population running into billions you will likely able cherry pick the worst that humanity has offer but consider looking the totality including the enormity the challenge and how vastly more complex this challenge for country like india and remember only when you are scrabbling daily eke out living when you are competing for extremely limited resources overcrowded society when all the ugliness all the clannisness and tribalism all the xenophobia rises the top just look how little took for the alt right movement the xenophobia the muslim hate the brexit kick ,1

 see your point and agree totally its fault democracy that most people vote for the person his charisma and not his policies ability govern this present even western countries although feel people are much better informed countries like germany and scandinavian countries also congress has allowed itself defined raga theirs internal competition for him the party and its clearly not working for them,1
here your attention that you expected now let point that you come asshole with elitist complex just because you use fancy hip tags identify yourself with and politicise and base your decisions according individual level think threatening the harmony what was before compared now and the reason could because portrayal media and centrist and panendeist yes fancy tags see the irony here refuse indulge side politics and judge people based policies actions and performance with that being said also like say that you biased about modi hence you don find any counter the original india sub because obviously that tune with your ideology and confirms the that you built for over the years and hating entire particular side based party power going the same regressive path which and the west leading would never result good positive change society because reality the matter far from good and evil and would far say religion doesn matter and shouldn vote people based that but competence does and honestly modi has proven himself successful and competent than congress before him and you cannot deny the impact that has made the world which only shows and proves about his succesful performance and tenure prime minister country and think lacking any other competent options congress the left side this obviously the best bet for the country ,1

what have seen that this government adamant implying taxes the middle class and the lower class but far source income concerned they always give vague explanations why they not par with the cost living first the pension defense personnel were cut back then more than years delay implying 7th pay commission cost pulses vegetables and daily goods have not been checked moreover the demonetization the banknotes did nothing the rich were hardly affected and the burden was borne the lower and middle class people lynching people the name national integrity cannot accepted they put ban the internal consumption beef products only benefit from export there are many things that need see research and gauge out ourselves but that cannot happen while blindly accept what the government asks why are paying taxes transacting from our own account granted that using atms other than our own banks should incur charges but simply extortion the government that have pay them even when taking out own money economy big ours cannot survive solely cashless transactions when are still struggling with basic necessities such employment farmer loans lack infrastructure the rural areas and most importantly the failing illusion secularism and the idea free speech ,1

 don think indians hindus specifically have problem with muslims per terms religion think hindus have problem with their own self esteem and ego maybe because come from typical kshatriya family martial caste all family military but there was lot rhetoric about how xyz year beat the mughals curiously there was similar rhetoric about beating the english mostly because never were even close beating them and capitulated easily see muslims adversaries because were conquered and humilated them and can actually fight back against them happened case the english well but could never fight back try regain some sort pride reconquering our former conquerors kind like how kid gets beaten two different bullies vows take revenge but one the bullies moves abroad lives good life and sometimes even apologizes the other bully lives right next door has shit life and small enough that you can fight him know this sounds like lunkhead explanation but from background makes some sense least ,1

 continuing from the kashmir post where comments were locked think there are some routes that can taken article 35a removal this very controversial article probably utmost importance least according what hear and read arbitrarily gives the state legislature powers that have place the kind democracy functioning india our democracy has been often criticized quasi federal federal with unitary bias because ours was experiment that had never even been conceived let alone tried anywhere the world land with multitudes language cultures and religions function democracy would either fall apart turn into autocracy the majority were the prevailing views 1947 there reason usa placed itself strategically closer pakistan hypothesized its homogeneity would help grow faster and remain stable india belied all their hopes the reason sheer ingenuity our constitution and inhuman capabilities our earlier leaders kashmir throughout remained out the loop due the very article question the example berlin before 1989 when east and west berlin existed eastern half was under communist regime ussr and the western under three nations usa and france the west was developed under open market economics while being financially helped the three nations east simultaneously remained stagnant and suffered akin the other balkan nations the easterners could see the west developing and wanted flee that side much that east germany government built the historic berlin wall could for starters remove the article 35a and allow free movement every sense accord with the constitution the kashmiris would want whats happening say mumbai bangalore than multan even bloody sinkiang region china thus exposure the wide world and idea what lies fully integrated himachal pradesh often the highest preforming state many indexes revered and often read immediate neighbor kashmir they won even have far and manage that who knows pok revolts join the mainstream kashmir just like the berlin wall fell 1989 must prove action time for theory crafting long past for investors shying away keynesian economics state where private investment dries public investment must step our government can spend 3600 cores statue with roi sight developing state the very breathing living people constitutionally bound serve will always find funds education due article 35a not many good schools could operate ratio the population demand the kashmiri pandit exodus drove away the majority educated populace this resulted young children aged attending madarsas for education when they graduated the age nearly years indoctrination resulted jilted attitude towards the nation large and extreme religious outlook the maulvis these madarsas often instilled separatist and jihadist thoughts inside these very impressionable brains also the lack exposure the rest the country meant these could not washed away when society taught something without external stimuli they become sounding boards for each other and and reinforce their self imposed thoughts painstakingly long process but probably the only one these are some the \ points could think right now but there are many many ways can bring them back internet the last remaining democracy let loose the jio adventure them when they see the lifestyle average mumbai bangalore citizen and compare with that any big pakistani city average citizen mind you they will know where secularism will lead and where religious indoctrination you can wish away disaster nor fight with weapons idea and very destructive idea has made home their brains what must slowly but surely ,1

 think the feeling here that they are not being heard before jaya death there was atleast feeling that there someone strong enough take our issues the center but since her death the govt seen puppet the center and its functioning only because modi help ops himself accepted this recent interview speech there sense helplessness amongst the people and that why people had come out huge numbers for jallikattu because they were sure that the govt would not anything make case for against the center have not seen this kind mobilization for protests before jaya death maybe social media contributed well but this being taken advantage ever protesting groups like seeman vaiko etc can only hope that this interim phase and would end when the next elections happen and proper govt elected having said that well deserved especially with the way modi has put state elections ahead governance ,1

 just shut and follow ikeda “that the way practice correctly” shintaro ishihara diet member grandson died truly would have been alright hadn but buddhist punishment for slandering ishihara thought was fool despised and tried make fool anyone who meets gains fortune anyone who betrays antagonizes will fall into hell this the severe law buddhism remember that well all ikeda own words nichiren’ “standard proof” “doesn’ apply daisaku” “ the sensei” leader permitted acquire following his own for would divisive incursion into president ikeda prerogatives supreme leader source forget about raising successors and the next generation ends with ikeda whatever and the say and print are true “that mindset must cease” this something that work toward here the ikeda worship which ikeda himself promotes truly disgusting gotten infinitely worse since the nichiren shoshu priesthood excommunicated ikeda and removed his dumb cult from their list approved lay organizations take look daisaku ikeda the world’ foremost authority nichiren buddhism source that what found over one the sgi many vanity presses paid for the sgi members donations which exists only publish things written others that daisaku ikeda name rubber stamped can pretend author all the cult leaders self publish via their own culty little vanity presses why should daisaku ikeda considered the world foremost authority nichiren buddhism never completed any formal course study never been tonsured has credentials whatsoever even people the real world don consider him legitimate scholar examination soka education necessitates reiterating its virtual unfamiliarity academic and educational circles outside japan therefore any critical analysis soka comes with the proviso that great deal what has been written about this approach its principal proponents currently inaccessible for broad based study the chief reasons for this are twofold firstly neither makiguchi toda nor ikeda are regarded scholars any traditional sense they were not university educated formally trained academics and therefore their essentially makiguchi’ and toda’ publications were largely relegated relative obscurity japanese educational spheres source 2016 1138575 credentials matter outside cult leader little cult personality there are plenty priests nichiren priests who have been studying everything nichiren and lotus sutra since their teens who have devoted their entire careers and lifetimes the study these teachings while daisaku ikeda has instead chosen jet setting lifestyle paying various people meet with him sit for photo that will then played like was some big deal daisaku ikeda has never shakubukued single person even apparently simply being the top authoritarian the soka gakkai organizations makes him default the world foremost authority the three top theoreticians the gakkai the supreme theoretician course president ikeda followed probably kodaira yoshihei toda convert member parliament general administrator and the head the study department supreme theoretician simply the prerogative the topmost authoritarian the dictatorship pyramid sure sounds like that the award you win for seizing the presidency hmm little could anyone have ever imagined that when ikeda was born would mentor leader peace activist and truly one the greatest humans that has ever lived source one the greatest humans that has ever lived wowzers who said humility and modesty had any place within true buddhism remember ikeda permitting this sort grotesque hero worship not outright designing everyone sgi should embarrassed this naked preening and self glorification why should ikeda considered the supreme theoretician anyone can say that where the actual proof where the evidence that ikeda does fact possess the requisite qualifications where are ikeda credentials what legitimate study program has ikeda completed dropped out community college his very first semester ikeda has nothing and yet the sgi members are supposed believe that this greedy grasping little man who has only ever sought power and wealth somehow more knowledgeable than the priests who devoted themselves study and practice for entire careers and even lifetimes obscene scandal this not buddhism this one hopelessly insecure little man quest for immortality ikeda bound for oblivion just surely any other person who has ever existed eternity will not remember his name anyone source and what about actual proof ikeda favorite son died age stomach ailment that rarely fatal for all his efforts ikeda has failed awarded the nobel peace prize all ikeda jibbajabba about making the impossible possible sure looks like empty words doesn ikeda can make work when has the luxury devoting every moment every day what chance you have making work and what about world peace than when toda recreated the soka gakkai after wwii things have been getting better anywhere the world thanks the ikeda cult ikeda and his dumb cult are useless all this worship daisaku ikeda isn doing anyone bit good except for daisaku ikeda course how demeaning being nothing more than chorus member sing the praises one self important little swine man that all the sgi members exist for what about ikeda life worth emulating has friends hasn been able shakubuku single person everybody japan hates him doesn even have any grandchildren his own family completely broken ikeda nothing but vampire who thinks can suck away everyone else life force and money and thus live forever ,1

neutral observer here wandered here after newspaper story and reddit thread and followed with bit research here are two cents nytimes and wapo story noticed that the visit the border was under pakistan army supervision and journalist posed any independent question the locals not think army would leave any bodies around and terrorist camps lying around when journalists visit they were pushing pretty unbelievable agenda and journalists did not any investigative journalism when comes pakistan wise untrust them they even denied usama bin laden presence why would indian dgmo issue statement they hit launch pads territory under their control understand there are lots sensitivities due both being nuclear states and hence the statement being mild avoid annoying various powers this was the same terminology used when india hit myanmar camps another major point was that some other nations were immediately briefed india definitely hit pakistani side these strikes ,1

absolutely true there are few more things that should included when looking his appeal firstly his strongman image india and also worldwide there trend towards people who make brash provocative statements being seen strong leaders trump for instance considered his supporters stronger leader than obama though the latter actually carried out more deportations and got osama killed modi takes step further and combines with bold not necessarily good initiatives like demo and the recent air strikes against pakistan now well known that demo was complete failure and what the air strikes actually achieved terms strategic objectives unclear best but from political perspective country like india these are brilliant moves after demo people were saying idea was good only implementation was bad though implementation optional component the govt responsibilities and not the most important component course the idea itself was insane but let not there this has led the least doing something syndrome despite the fact that previous govts also have done something yet that perception has been created and modi excellent spotting this key differentiator that why the govt keeps harping about nehru and other past and dead pms that why every bjp shill keeps parroting the white lie that nothing happened years combine that with the notion that everything the has done historic even when essentially rebranded existing initiatives but his greatest trump card was and will always rahul gandhi not only because that man walking gaffe machine fair modi but modi has carefully created media network that will suppress this fact the real problem with raga and his sister they are boy scout politicians raga seems have forgotten that the three state elections were not the thumping inc victories that were expected the inc won them very narrowly all modi needed turn the tide was major national crisis modi being political genius quickly seized upon pulwama even person who intensely dislikes modi and extremely skeptical his handling pulwama cannot imagine raga handling any better than modi finally has said that the alternatives are not very promising raga shitshow mamata the next most likely candidate just fascist and authoritarian modi not more most the opposition alliances only exist beat modi that the only glue holding these rivals together should they succeed that glue will dissolve and most people know this ,1

hey there glad that the path enriching your life much may you have great understanding and contentment your post sparked curiosity see have been practicing for years and focus personal study has been theravada nature there something calming about the simplicity theravada and what feels like its direct line the heart the teachings this being the case the sangha that have practiced with off and for the past years vietnamese pure land sangha namo adidaphat with large and beautiful temple near house absolutely love the community this temple and spent years heavily involved with them groundskeeping days week volunteering festivals and holy days helping the elderly their personal lives etc but the monastics and teachers who live visit not speak english well and the lay people hesitate get too deeply into teaching this has resulted this sangha being only that for community and example healthy buddhist living and not space learn more about the teachings have been theravada layman pure land temple during this time have formed some thoughts and personal opinions and questions about pure land and curious how you might feel about them being that you came from theravada pure land have felt strongly that pure land almost seems sort messianic buddhism have literally been told some the elders temple that things like meditation study buddhist psych etc are overkill for lay people have been encouraged simply chant the name amitaba over and over and visualize the pure land and the merit amida will somehow get into this ideal realm work further enlightenment this does not seem line well with understanding the buddha teachings understanding has been that the path personal journey leaving other power seems highly contrarian understanding the teachings lord buddha and find that the concept encourages less mindful own life and practice and the cycles cause and effect which ripple from existence have you felt anything like this how have you reconciled these feelings have you ever noticed similarity between pure land and christianity other messianic faiths not mean disrespectful unskillful these questions observations simply not know and would like perspective less biased than the ones receive the pure land temple invite anyone respond here please help understand mind open namo \ \ \\\ \ ,1

what caught eye was his pointing out the application the term sacred history semitic faiths and myth non semitic faiths including course hinduism amused because ‘sacred history’ deliciously creative euphemism for ‘christian mythology’ concrete and real sounding the word ‘mythology’ have noticed over time reserved anglophones for any non semitic stories greek norse hindu buddhist roman etc whereas when comes time describing their own mythology anglophones use ‘scripture’ and never ‘mythology’ but think ‘sacred history’ even better implying there ‘real’ history and then ‘sacred’ history which true there history and then there myth and ends thus with exceptions like amitabh ghosh’ ‘the shadow lines’ the entire corpus indo anglian literature leaves little cold like making love through interpreter ,1

 don think that surprising that right leaning politicians win elections around half the time the yes obama was president from 2009 2017 but before that george bush was president for years and before clinton republicans won out presidential elections between 1968 and 1988 these things tend back and forth like pendulum one side wins then takes things too far people put the other side charge for while the same most democratic countries different question but maybe the one you are really trying ask why immigration and nationalism have become hot button issues the last few years the 1990s and 2000s the right was more free market pro trade pro immigration because pro business but the last decade has because more nationalistic populist anti trade and anti immigration there are several explanations but every country going have different one for example europe has largely been driven the refugee crisis and the poor way that has been handled the various governments the began with the financial crisis and increase immigration under bush but has also been driven liberal overreach number social issues under obama top this you got social media replacing television the main way people get news that local incidents are often blown into national incidents would also note that both left and right the extremes are getting more attention you have sanders the facto leader democrats the corbyn the leader labour the melenchon doing quite well france etc ,1

this comment will probably get buried but would like put something out there and please correct wrong the problem lies all three domains healthcare india administration financing and service delivery there are both private and public health sector india public hospitals were already free and quite affordable other circumstances believe however the problem exists financing and service delivery there some not all public hospitals are not funded well and hence the poor service delivery and long waitings and some cases subpar quality what would like see more funding diverted towards public hospitals and strict regulation how health service delivered the front line this move promising free coverage would just another way attracting votes this seems benefit only private sector becomes free for poor public but then again private sector would need subsidized government pay for the services being used under free healthcare umbrella more likely diverting funding away from public health sectors for balanced budget don seem wrap head around far but hopefully will favour public edit adding after quickly glancing through the linked article seems like also talking about indian handing out 500 000 rupees worth coverage annually poor communities not sure its allotted single individual household either way personally don think capping the medical expenditure that will provided free cost will ideally any good people would still unable use private hospitals fulfill their needs because what corrupted private hospitals overcharge individual one will out r500 000 single hospitalization period without any strict supervision that end that poor person wouldn even able defend their case either because legal fees and all another whole issue not only that r500 000 doesn sound lot when considering the costs treatments and diagnostic tests provided through private hospitals one also looking accommodation transport and unavoidable costs when receiving that medical care especially for person need who belongs remote area common that financially unstable person tends explore public hospitals save that capped medical expenditure service delivery those public hospitals would still the same right now unless administration actually begins finance fund those hospitals aid them deliver quality care ,1

 would like add few points would much venture and say the media had studied indian media 2014 they would have learnt lot lessons before the elections don belittle the opposition and anybody who has opposing view point the left liberal narrative india was and rss agent out kill muslims and slay the christian infidel you can see echoes this this day where the 2014 elections are derided victory for communal forces though the 150 million votes who voted nda are all bloodthirsty bigots accept the opposing view point give them listen understand what they want what they aspire what drives them vote for the candidate they want vote for not dismiss out hand then prevents you from formulating appropriate response the people not vote some esoteric principles they vote for access roti kapada aur pani leave alone makaan you can talk yourselves blue the face some ndtv discussion your studio about the principles the idea india the fact remains the majority vote because they want see person given them full belly some clean water drink and some decent clothes wear you can give this them they will vote you out the upa misread this entirely and utterly did the nda the indian media continues misread esp the left liberals the country they don care what happens some jnu president they care about themselves and their families finito even here not enough that understand the person the average voter wants but the motives that drive the person chose the leader crucial understand the electorate you are longer the only media source out there even years ago the media houses wrote the news scripted agendas and created narratives today world shitty forward from your next door unkil has more currency for the average citizen than some amazing passionate well written oped amartya sen aravind panagriya sad but the truth this can cut both ways can force good you can easily rile large sections the populace with well timed well crafted shitty whatsapp tweet either ways the fact remains that news media has competition and crowd sourced high time they woke which brings subpoint allow opposing view point primetime media starting 2012 all the media houses bar none till times now shifted towards modi midway into the 2014 campaign followed the exact same homogenous template which resulted the exact same things being said modi won even nominated will moderate now that modi nominated will hung parliament needing regional politicians seats hence modi will replaced now that modi has won and here the pendulum swung the other extreme will create this super small cabinet plutocrats and forth point 100 the mainstream english media said the exact same things resulting homogenity news that drowned out anything that the real world was feeding back them these are all the exact same mistakes the media and liberal establishment made with trump not case the indian media and liberal establishment learning from 2016 but the media and liberals should have learnt from india 2014 ,1

 was also really shocked the turn the tide especially against modi mean remember how was almost national hero the time was elected great brown hope speak has much hope placed upon him and now entire states are protesting his arrival and the atmosphere around his party has turned toxic all this just few short years guess this fast paced internet age the old slow and traditional ways life that india has long known are finding themselves war with new and more youthful mindsets and the country just doesn know how cope with the conflicts fear that there may many more such birthing pains this india eventually finds its own equilibrium may well take years even decades before such thing happens but the most important thing can stay positive and keep reinforcing positive ideals being the change gandhi said the key ,1

 guess nri have been living europe for years now however have not gone modi rally wish had the time would have liked pursuing phd electrical engineering atheist but when was younger took part the rituals just avoid drama don like hindutva politics hate that things like killings over beef are taking place hate the discrimination that dalits muslims and other minoritites face yet bjp supporter being nri and supporting party home dilemma while can vote should because the result not going affect bad for the average resident indian however when you are removed from the mundane politics everyday life and read only what you can from news both indian and foreign you gain more neutral view the situation have met lot indians abroad and wish could say that met lot congress supporters however did not almost every person met supported bjp remember literally only one person who was anti bjp and was from tamil nadu wasnt congress supporter either least this the situation europe maybe the indian community the other parts different why support modi first reason because believe that out all messed politicians the country the best person lead the country right now there were good competitor would open support him but right now don see anyone second reason whatever the state the country the work congress one cannot look what the country today and blame bjp for all its problems strides the situation minorities poverty and such negative aspects plus opening economy increasing literacy disease reduction and such positive aspects are all because congress when one looks all the positives and negatives the last years not all bad but could have been lot better say that certain situations are the result bjp naive however one looks one place where bjp has had long time influence and that gujrat desert one the leading producers certain crops that small achievement and riots again were the result long history violence there under congress rule bjp cannot blamed for that and violence has decreased substantially under bjp rule gujrat third right now people are celebrating the fact that the supreme court has saved democracy karnataka people are convinced the sancticity the supreme court then its judgement modi must also honored how can one celebrate its verdict when favor congress but doubt when favor bjp fourth hearing modi speak only ever talks about development don understand how people accuse him divisive politics when have only ever heard talk about development this leads move away from congress because feel they are lying critisiscm can respect this policy bad for these reasons like shashi tharoors objections government push make hindi language the agreed with congress there however inventing stuff and then critisising like the divisive politics stuff hard digest because the conditions that exist today are the congress making and blaming bjp for feels wrong fifth looking policies the majorities policieslook good from outside again this because one does not feel the effects nri easy praise demonetization and gst from outside because one sees the numbers and feels good without facing the downsides like waiting atm etc and maybe people might criticize demonetization implementation but was actually successful for excercise this scale venezuela tried after india did but could not manage and much smaller country the end nri want the best for the country congress policies seem good would happily support but the moment despite all the negative stuff about bjp still looks better for the country than congress ,1

 what would releasing video footage achieve the people that aren’ convinced official announcement the dgmo will dismiss and video footage photos “doctored” just easily this absolutely correct the intention doubt the narrative amount evidence going convince anyone otherwise second the fencing along the loc all indian til this true were there pakistani contributions all towards the fence that unbelievable and finally very possible that modi lulled the pakistanis into false sense security with the indus waters treaty bluff and the let fight war poverty instead speech kozhikode they may have raised alert levels for week following the attack but those would been dialed down once they were convinced that india was all talk and action was masterpiece deception and timing maybe but all the things you said far this was far the weakest would assume this just modi being passive aggressive his foreign policy instead playing some diabolical chess with pakistan the tactical impact may negligible but the strategic and political implications are immense india has now shown that she can – and will – respond provocations with force your opinion you think has happened earlier the congress said something week the effect raids happened during congress time also didn parrot around after something gen deepak kapoor said want know how much their statements are valid and how many are invalid asking you this because after there were similar questions surgical strike ece began coming out something that you can really see today the idsa has written good pieces advocating for more muscular policy against terrorists following which you can read here 11theisraeliwayandrelevanceforindia sscrajiv 261109 modi initial attempts diplomacy with pakistan were ensure that peace was given chance that’ why invited sharif his inauguration and made “surprise visit” lahore for further talks after the pathankot attack took the unprecedented step allowing pakistani investigation team into the base gave the pakistanis chance prove that things had indeed changed and that state support for terrorism would cease that turned out not the case the investigators had the nerve suggest that the attack was false flag operation orchestrated india yes india needs have the carrot and the stick while dealing with any its more antagonistic partners neighbors more concerned with the fact that our troops are getting killed ways troops not get killed during peacetime these kinds things being the norm are unacceptable india shouldn allow this area thorn its side any longer marks sea change from the previous policy seeking cessation hostilities through diplomatic means alone and persisting with the notion that diplomacy would work one day even though had failed for the past seventy years contradict you bit opinion the current government for various reasons elections indirect message pakistan whatever opts publicize their diplomatic and foreign policy actions through the media and other sources has been the policy india far understated its approach through foreign policy think india becoming more overtly aggressive now control the narrative easier since the tide opinions that matter public media political can always turn instant this may advised ill advised tell you which context this would ill advised currently india flexed muscles and attacked terrorists the pok some time later group carried out some attacks urban india and caused catastrophic damage life property and morale what would india they claimed show courage and pro activity dismantling hostile forces our backyard but what these forces recoup and attack would deeply humiliating and shocking correct this risk always exists this surgical strike isn end point india needs play its cards smarter and the worst part don think the indian government even has positive experience controlling the narrative could wrong this could all blow its face instant and the entire image they cultivating could pop was would publicize the surgical strikes and compare the attacks that pakistan military itself faced the pns mehran kamra the nfwp from terrorists that did not happen hoped modi would like india and pakistan face attacks their military from these terrorists hope that our mission helps innocent soldiers both sides the border from threats life sounds reasonable head playing pakistani emotion and love for raheel sharif who credit where its due stomped and killed terrorism plaguing karachi much could their soldiers died shareef took retaliatory action indian soldiers died modi took retaliatory action fairs fair right just want you address this one thing your post the false narrative that the attackers were anguished kashmiris fighting indian oppression entirely possible but unless there ready proof for choose assume its false narrative enjoy your gold buddy ,1

here the thing about meritocracy when you systematically subdue particular section society creating multiple hurdles their socio educational advancement you are rewarded with less competition for the sought after jobs and seats educational institutes since the said sections society are longer able compete against you this like breaking the legs your opponent before the race that you can later win the race merit what affirmative action does removes the disability imposed that particular section society reserving fair share seats for example what proportion seats would have been occupied scs who constitute the population had they not been treated like dirt for thousands years yes exactly what proportion would have been occupied women had they been treated like actual human beings with actual brains exactly before you start guessing let tell you general category male and support not but seats for women both jobs education and parliament assemblies real meritocracy everyone should able compete without the disabilities imposed them society compared the privileged sections when compete for job with others don want take seat which would have otherwise gone woman but got that seat just because society thinks men are more meritorious the reservation based economic criteria sure dubious almost entire india earns less than 8lpa 8lpa poor then mukesh ambani middle class ,1

 left india 2009 was always politically informed until that point and was deeply disillusioned with the way things were moving general sense the pride had hometown chennai began dissipating grew older when saw its inclusive nature being eroded constantly and replaced majoritarian inward looking and insular ideology but still held with hope knew first hand the extraordinary people that lived india but 2014 think jumped the shark that was the moment where thought that didn feel like belonged india anymore rather the idea what india was seemed have been irreversibly changed this mass murdering fanatic and while still hold myself indian just don relate what this government and this idea india represents really sickening was this point that for the first time decided that would naturalise where was living and put citizenship application few weeks earlier nothing have seen since 2014 convinced change mind did the opposite actually strengthening resolve maybe this because remember the vajpayee years and while they were nowhere near what the last few years have been soon the bjp get into power the communal noises are amped and vajpayee still man character relative moderate but that party has had several hardcore communal pricks and they now front and centre ,-1
